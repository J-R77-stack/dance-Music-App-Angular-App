# DanceMusicApp

I‚Äôm so happy to finally finish the first version of the Angular project I have been working on for several months. As a Deep House music fan, I wanted to develop an app with Angular and the Spotify Api to view the latest tracks and playlists found on the platform of my favorite Djs. I wanted the user to beable to hear snippets of the tracks and then beable to click on a link to play the full version on Spotify.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- Authenticate with the Spotify api to get the relevant data to the front end.
- Navigate between Home and other dj pages
- Click on audio snippets of the tracks to get a feel for the record
- Click on the image of the track to navigate to the spotify app to hear the full record

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- scss styles
- Bootstrap 5
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/)
- [Angular](https://angular.dev/)

### What I learned

This was a very difficult project and I spent countless hours trying different things and reading stuff online and also researching the spotify docs to find the information I needed, Somehow after much perseverance I managed to get the app working using various bits of information jumbled together.

The Spotify API provides access to user related data, like playlists and music. The base address of Web API is https://api.spotify.com. The API provides a set of endpoints, each with its own unique path. All requests to Web API require authentication. This is achieved by sending a valid OAuth access token in the request header.

In order to centralize requests to Spotify, I have created a Service called spotify-auth.service.ts, in which I used the PKCE extension to keep my 'client secret' a secret. I created a spotify app in the api to obtain a 'client secret and client id'. This then allowed me to obtain a new access token whenever I made get requests to the api. I then set up the redirect URI to ‚Äúhttp://localhost:4200/callback‚Äù for development and 'https://dance-music-app-angular-app.vercel.app/callback' for production.

I installed sha.js which will be used to hash with Sha256 which is needed for PKCE in the spotify-auth.service.ts. It allowed me to get a new access token everytime i authenticated with the spotify api instead of having to manually insert it every hour.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("üéâ");
};
```
